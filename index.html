        A large number library that you can copy-paste directly into your .js file. It is easier to use than traditional libraries, is not very laggy (my game Exotic Matter Dimensions uses it and the lag is minimal) and only takes up around 100 lines of code (60 if you are using Fundamental).<br>
        infOP, similarly to logarithmica.numerus by Aarex Tiaokhiao, stores each number as a logarithm - for example, the number <tt>149600000</tt> is stored as <tt>8.174931594</tt>. This allows numbers to go up to 1e1.79e308. The built-in functions make it easy to add, subtract and format these "exponents".<br>
        infOP is split into Fundamental and Advanced versions. The Fundamental version only includes necessary functions and is easier to use, whereas the Advanced version includes a lot more functions, but is a lot longer and the documentation is harder to navigate.<br>
        In this documentation and function names, the prefix norm indicates an ordinary number (<tt>5</tt> means <tt>5</tt>) and the prefix inf indicates a logarithm variable (<tt>5</tt> means <tt>100000</tt>)
